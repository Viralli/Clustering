Output:

    Please refer to README.md section to see the output for DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm(Graphical Representation)

Output Explanation:

The provided code (for the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) Algorithm) uses the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to cluster a set of 
2D data points and visualize the results. Here is a brief explanation of the output:

1. Data Points:

    The scatter plot displays all the data points in black.

2. Core Points:

    Core points are highlighted in red and are larger in size.

    These points have at least `min_pts` (2) neighboring points within the `eps` (2.0) radius.

3. Cluster Labels:

    Each core point is labeled with its respective cluster number.

    Points belonging to the same cluster share the same number and are grouped together.

4. Noise Points:

    Noise points are marked with yellow crosses.

    These points do not belong to any cluster as they do not have enough neighboring points.

5. Cluster Representation:

    Points belonging to the same cluster are represented with the same color.

    The plot visually differentiates between different clusters, core points, and noise points.

The final plot effectively shows the clustering results, highlighting core points, clusters, and noise points, providing a clear understanding of how DBSCAN has partitioned the dataset.
