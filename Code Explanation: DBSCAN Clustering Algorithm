Code Explanation:

1. Importing Libraries and Data Setup:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

# Sample data points
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 1], [1.5, 1.8], [0, 1], [1, 0.6], [5, 8], [8, 8], [9, 11]])

         Here, `numpy` is imported for numerical operations, and `DBSCAN` is imported from `sklearn.cluster` for clustering operations. The `X` array represents the sample data points in a 2-dimensional space.

2. DBSCAN Parameters:

eps = 2.0  # Maximum radius of the neighborhood
min_pts = 2  # Minimum number of points to form a cluster

        Parameters `eps` and `min_pts` are set to `2.0` and `2`, respectively. `eps` defines the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors, and `min_pts` specifies the minimum number of 
        points required to form a dense region (cluster).

3.  Performing DBSCAN Clustering:

dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=eps, min_samples=min_pts)
labels = dbscan.fit_predict(X)

        The `DBSCAN` object is created with the specified `eps` and `min_samples` parameters. `fit_predict(X)` computes DBSCAN clustering and assigns cluster labels to each point in `X`.

4. Core Samples and Labels:

core_samples_mask = np.zeros_like(dbscan.labels_, dtype=bool)
core_samples_mask[dbscan.core_sample_indices_] = True

        `core_samples_mask` identifies core points, which are points that have at least `min_pts` within their `eps` neighborhood.

5. Printing DBSCAN Parameters and Explanations:

print("DBSCAN Parameters and Explanations:")
print(f"eps: {eps} (maximum radius of the neighborhood)")
print(f"min_pts: {min_pts} (minimum number of points to form a cluster)\n")

        This section prints out the parameters eps and min_pts used for DBSCAN clustering, providing an overview of the clustering criteria.

6. Printing DBSCAN Clustering Results:

print("DBSCAN Clustering Results:")
for i in range(len(X)):
    if core_samples_mask[i]:
        print(f"Choosing Core Point: {X[i]}")
        neighbors = np.where(dbscan.components_ == i)[0]
        print(f"Finding Eps-Neighborhood: {list(neighbors)}")
        print(f"Core Point Check: Point {X[i]} is chosen as a core point with neighbors {list(neighbors)}.")

        # Handling noise
        if labels[i] == -1:
            print("Handling Noise: This core point has been marked as noise.")
        else:
            print(f"Expand the Cluster: Expanding cluster around point {X[i]} with neighbors {list(neighbors)}.")
            print(f"Assign Border Points: Assigning border points to cluster {labels[i]}.\n")

        This section iterates through each data point to report which points are core points, their neighbors within `eps`, and how clusters expand or handle noise points based on DBSCAN's output labels.

7. Printing Noise Points and Final Clusters:

print("Noise Points:")
for i in range(len(X)):
    if labels[i] == -1:
        print(f"Noise Identification: Point {X[i]}.")

print("\nFinal Clusters:")
unique_labels = set(labels)
for label in unique_labels:
    if label != -1:
        print(f"\nCluster {label}: Points {list(X[labels == label])}")

    Finally, this part prints identified noise points and summarizes the final clusters formed by DBSCAN, excluding noise points.
