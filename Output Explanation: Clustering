Output Explanation:

Dataset Generation

Dataset with clear cluster structure generated.

    A synthetic dataset with four distinct clusters was created using the `make_blobs` function from `scikit-learn`.

KMeans Clustering (Flat Algorithm, Hard Clustering)

Applying Flat Algorithm: KMeans (Hard Clustering)

    The KMeans algorithm was applied, assigning each data point to one of four clusters based on proximity to the cluster centers.

Agglomerative Clustering (Hierarchical Algorithm, Hard Clustering)

Applying Hierarchical Algorithm: Agglomerative Clustering (Hard Clustering)

    Agglomerative Clustering, a hierarchical approach, was used to form clusters by recursively merging smaller clusters until four clusters were formed.

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM, Soft Clustering)

Applying Soft Clustering: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

    The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was applied, providing probabilities for each data point's membership in each of the four clusters.

GMM Cluster Probabilities

Sample cluster probabilities (first 5 samples):
Sample 1: [2.59296402e-02 9.71688955e-01 8.04672295e-21 2.38140471e-03]
Sample 2: [7.15846263e-09 7.13116691e-33 9.99999993e-01 2.34837535e-15]
Sample 3: [9.99999970e-01 8.78022033e-12 2.04767765e-08 9.13480329e-09]
Sample 4: [1.51487210e-09 7.76731322e-35 9.99999998e-01 3.38693314e-18]

    The probabilities for the first five samples show the likelihood of each sample belonging to each of the four clusters, illustrating GMM's(Gaussian Mixture Model) soft clustering approach.
