Output Explanation

K-means Clustering:

Centroids:

[[7.33333333 9.        ]
 [1.16666667 1.46666667]]

The K-means clustering algorithm has identified two centroids:

        The first centroid is at coordinates (7.333, 9.0)
        The second centroid is at coordinates (1.167, 1.467).

Cluster assignments:

[1 1 0 0 1 0]

The points are assigned to clusters as follows:

        Points [1, 2], [1.5, 1.8], and [1, 0.6] belong to the second cluster (centroid at (1.167, 1.467)).
        Points [5, 8], [8, 8], and [9, 11] belong to the first cluster (centroid at (7.333, 9.0)).

Polygon Area Calculation:
Apothem of the polygon:

Apothem:

The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. It can be calculated using the following formula:

                                                         Apothem= side_length/2⋅tan(π/num_sides)

Where:
side_length is the length of one side of the polygon.
num_sides is the number of sides of the polygon.
π is the mathematical constant Pi (≈3.14159)

Apothem of the polygon:

    4.330127018922194

    The apothem (distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) of a regular hexagon with side length 5 is 4.330.

Area of the Polygon (using perimeter and apothem):

The area of a regular polygon can be calculated using its perimeter and apothem with the following formula:

                                                       Area= 1/2⋅Perimeter⋅Apothem

Where:

Perimeter=num_sides⋅side_length
Apothem is calculated as shown above.

Area of the polygon (using perimeter and apothem):

    64.9519052838329

    The area of the hexagon, calculated using its perimeter and apothem, is approximately 64.952.

Area of the Polygon (using direct formula):

    The area of a regular polygon can also be calculated directly using the side length and the number of sides with the following formula:

                                                   Area= num_sides.side_length^2/4⋅tan(π/num_sides)

Where:
num_sides is the number of sides of the polygon.
side_length is the length of one side of the polygon.
π is the mathematical constant Pi (≈3.14159)

Area of the polygon (using direct formula):

    64.9519052838329

    The area of the hexagon, calculated using the direct formula involving the side length and number of sides, is also approximately 64.952.   

Summary:
    The K-means clustering algorithm successfully clustered the example points into two groups with centroids at (7.333, 9.0) and (1.167, 1.467).

    The polygon area calculation functions correctly computed the apothem and area of a regular hexagon with a side length of 5.

Cluster assignments: [1 1 0 0 1 0]
Apothem of the polygon: 4.330127018922194
Area of the polygon (using perimeter and apothem): 64.9519052838329
Area of the polygon (using direct formula): 64.9519052838329
