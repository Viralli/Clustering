Output Explanation:

DBSCAN Parameters and Explanations:

eps: 2.0 (maximum radius of the neighborhood): This parameter defines the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors within the same cluster. In this case, any two points within 2.0 units of 
each other are considered neighbors.

min_pts: 2 (minimum number of points to form a cluster): This parameter specifies the minimum number of points required to form a dense region, which becomes a core point. In this context, a core point must have at 
least 2 neighboring points within its `eps` radius to form a cluster.

DBSCAN Clustering Results:

1. Choosing Core Point: [1. 2.]

        This point [1. 2.] is identified as a core point because it has at least `min_pts` (2) neighbors within its `eps` distance.

2. Finding Eps-Neighborhood: [3]

        Points [3] are identified as neighbors of the core point [1. 2.] within the specified `eps` radius.

3. Core Point Check: Point [1. 2.] is chosen as a core point with neighbors [3].

        Confirms that [1. 2.] meets the criteria to be a core point, supported by its neighbors [3].

4. Expand the Cluster: Expanding cluster around point [1. 2.] with neighbors [3].

        Initiates the expansion of the cluster around [1. 2.] to include its neighboring points [3].

5. Assign Border Points: Assigning border points to cluster 0.

        Assigns points within the `eps` radius of core points but not dense enough to be core points themselves to the cluster. These are known as border points.

6. Noise Points:

       Points [5. 8.], [8. 8.], and [9. 11.] are identified as noise because they do not fit into any cluster based on the given `eps` and `min_pts` parameters.

Final Clusters:

    Cluster 0: Includes points that are part of the same dense region. In this output, Cluster 0 contains points [1. 2.], [1. 1.], [1.5, 1.8], [0. 1.], and [1. 0.6]. These points are connected either directly or 
    
    through other core points and form a cohesive cluster.

Explanation of Blank "Finding Eps-Neighborhood:"

In DBSCAN clustering, 'Finding Eps-Neighborhood' shows the indices of points that are neighbors of a core point within its distance threshold (eps). This neighborhood can be blank ([]) for a core point in the 
following cases:

(a)Isolated Core Point: If a core point has no other points within its eps distance (i.e., no neighbors that satisfy the eps condition apart from itself), the "Finding Eps-Neighborhood" will be empty ([]).
This indicates that the core point is isolated in its own cluster.

(b)Border Points: Border points are within the eps radius of a core point but do not have enough neighbors to become core points themselves. Therefore, their "Finding Eps-Neighborhood" might also be empty if they do 
not meet the min_pts criteria to form a core point.

(c)Noise Points: Noise points, which do not belong to any cluster, will naturally have an empty "Finding Eps-Neighborhood" since they are not considered as core or border points in any cluster.
