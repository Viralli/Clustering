K Means Clustering

Definition

K Means Clustering is a widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm that divides a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It iteratively assigns each data point to one of the K clusters based on 
feature similarity.

K Means Clustering with Convex Hulls Visualization

Overview

This project illustrates the application of the K Means algorithm to group a sample dataset and visualize the clusters with convex hulls. The convex hulls outline each cluster's boundaries, giving a clear geometric view of 
the data points and making the clustering results easier to understand.

Convex Hulls

Convex hulls are geometric shapes that outline the outer boundaries of each cluster. They provide a clear representation of how data points are grouped together in space.

Implementation Details

Dataset Generation: We generate a synthetic dataset using `make_blobs` with 300 data points, 4 centers, and a standard deviation of 0.60.

K Means Clustering: The algorithm is initialized with K=4 clusters using the `KMeans` class from `sklearn.cluster`.

Visualization:

Part 1: Displays a scatter plot of the clustered data points, where each cluster is assigned a distinct color.

Part 2: Visualizes the convex hulls of the clusters using plot_convex_hulls. Each convex hull outlines the boundary of its corresponding cluster, offering a visual understanding of cluster shapes and distributions.

Benefits of Convex Hulls Visualization

Geometric Insight: Convex hulls provide geometric insights into the structure of clusters, helping in understanding the spatial arrangement and boundaries of data groups.

Enhanced Interpretation: By adding convex hulls to the scatter plot, we improve the clarity of the clustering results, making it easier to see how data points are grouped into clusters.

Convergence of K Means Clustering

The K Means algorithm converges when the centroids of the clusters no longer change significantly between iterations or when a specified number of iterations is reached. Convergence is achieved when the assignments of 
data points to clusters stabilize and centroids settle into their final positions.

Time Complexity in K Means Clustering

The time complexity of the K Means algorithm is O(n * K * I * d), where:

n is the number of data points,
K is the number of clusters,
I is the number of iterations until convergence,
d is the number of features in each data point.
