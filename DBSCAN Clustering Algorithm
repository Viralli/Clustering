DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm Example:

Initial Setup:

Assume the dataset:

Points = [(1, 2), (1.5, 1.8), (5, 8), (8, 8), (1, 0.6), (9, 11)]

Setting parameters for the DBSCAN algorithm:

Epsilon (ε): 2.0 (maximum distance between two points to be considered neighbors)

Minimum Points (MinPts): 2 (minimum number of points to form a dense region)

Step-by-Step Process:

`MinPts` - (Minimum Points)

1. Choosing Core Points:

    Core Point Definition: A point is considered a core point if it has at least `MinPts` points within its ε-neighborhood.

Procedure:

    Start with a random point and check its neighborhood.

    Example: Start with point `(1, 2)`.

    Calculate distances to all other points and check if the number of points within ε distance is at least `MinPts`.

2. Finding Eps-Neighborhood:

    Epsilon-Neighborhood Definition: The set of all points that are within distance ε from a given point.

Procedure:

    For point `(1, 2)`, calculate the distances to all other points.

    Select points within ε distance.

3. Core Point Check:

    Core Point Determination: A point is a core point if it has at least `MinPts` points (including itself) within its ε-neighborhood.

Procedure:

    For point `(1, 2)`, count the number of points in its neighborhood.

    If the count is at least `MinPts`, classify the point as a core point.

4. Expand the Cluster:

    After identifying a core point, include all points that are reachable within the ε distance to form the cluster.

Procedure:

    Start with the core point and include all nearby points within the ε distance.

5. Assign Border Points:

     Border Point Assignment: Points within the ε distance of a core point but without enough neighbors to be core points themselves are added to the nearest core point's cluster.

Procedure:

    1. Find points within the ε distance that are not core points.

    2. Add these points to the nearest core point's cluster.

6. Handling Noise:

        Noise Handling: Points that do not belong to any cluster (not core points and not border points) are considered noise.

    Procedure:

        Find points that are not core points or border points and classify them as noise.
